# AlarmClock
Intro:
This is an old project I made a while back. After finding it in my drawer I decided despite it not being good enough as a product that I would use it ðŸ˜…  it's worth documenting while I still somewhat remember what I did. Also, unlike many other projects the work I did at some point in time doesn't wanish.
